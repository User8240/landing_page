      Programming has always seemed to me like it was out of my reach.
      I'd always been awful at learning languages, so I couldn't imagine
      myself learning to code. It wasn't until I took my first computer
      science class in highschool that I had much interest in it; asside
      from thinking it was cool and some form of hacking. After joining
      the class, I fell in love with HTML. Although I may struggle with
      languages other than english (english too, sometimes), I'd been an
      avid journaler since I turned 14. I loved writing, and HTML reminded
      me of Google Docs or Word. It felt comfortable to me, almost like
      I already knew the language; or perhaps the grammar.

      At the start of the semester we learned how to convert numbers into 
      binary, and then into hexadecimal. I was fairly good at math at the
      time, and this made me feel like I was even better. I had never 
      applied my creativity in this way, and my math skills were paying 
      off simultaneously! I'd never felt like I was a very smart student
      before, but this class showed me what I truly could do. The teacher
      and I worked together on many things. I really looked up to him, and 
      deep down, I felt grateful to him. I wasn't aware of all he was doing
      for me at the time, but the progress I made that year was very clear.
      I was able to bring my gpa up to a 3.9 that year for the first time in 
      my life. The confidence I gained from this one class changed the way
      I view learning. I started to see that I could go places in my life, maybe 
      even be successful and pay my mom back for all she's done for me. I 
      could make my dad and step-Mom proud of me. 

      <p class="text-format">
        Coding taught me that I do not have to be good at everything to be 
        confident. I don't have to over-achieve to gain anyones respect.
        I learned that I was deserving of these things regardless of how 
        intelligent or capable others may percieve me to be.

        I joined Epicodus not only because I value the school and it's 
        accessibility/ affordability, but because I'm passionate 
        about coding and so is this school. The same way a writer 
        is passionate about their article, paper or journal. One day
        I will be very proud to say I was a student at Epicodus.

        <p>Project Description: Here we have a very good, 5 star (maybe), Chocolate Chip Cookie recipe! But don't get me wrong, I am not the owner of this well known, classically famous recipe that someone absolutely did not steal and put in on their facebook group.
